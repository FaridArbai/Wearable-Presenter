# Wearable Prensenter
Presentation controller for smart watches that run Android Wear OS, designed to take control of every single aspect regarding the presentation, from slides management to scheduled notifications through time. This project was implemented with the sole purpose of vanishing the need of manual pointers, therefore enhancing body communication through the freedom of hands.

The implemented functionalities are the following:
* Connection through wifi to the PC that hosts the presentation.
* Slides management, allowing to move forward and backwards through the presentation.
* Scheduled vibrating notifications: The user can set certain timeouts and the watch will silently vibrate passed those deadlines so that you can control the time flow through the presentation without even looking at the watch.
